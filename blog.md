# Day in the life

Today I am learning how to markdown a webpage with the basic_Mark Down_ language. As of right now it is very easy to understand and intuitive to write with. Initially I thought the only markdown language was html, which I think I have a pretty good handle on, but it has taken my a little over a month to fully feel comfutable and remember the syntax of. It is nice to know that all I have to do to get a quick webpage up is use a few symbols and voala, I have a basic page ready to go.

## Git and Github

I have started to learn how to use Github and make commits and push requests. I can now autosave my projects I am working on with a few simple commands in the command line. If for some reason a newer version of my code **breaks** I now am able to go back to a older version of said project where it did work. 
### To make a git save step by step
* to make git repository
$ git init: in current project directory to make repository
* to see new repository
$ ls -a : use the -a because . files are hidden



* To add file in terminal
$ git add file_name.html
* To commit file
$ git commit -m "add a short, descriptive present tense commit message here describing the changes made"
* To review git information
1. git log : lists commit history for current branch
2. git status: lists the files where changes have been made to be commited.
3. git about: lists the information about the currently assigned name of author
